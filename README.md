The app displays all the package cars in your operation.  To update the status of a package car first locate the number of the package car you want to update either by scrolling to it or search by number.

## Search

The search feature displays all package cars that contain the number searched for.  

### Example 1: 
Search for car number 657929:

### Example 2: 
Search for all cars with 998 in the number:

## Select Status Heavy, Light, or Empty

Select **'Heavy' (red)** for heavy volume.  Selecting 'Heavy' indicates that the package car needs to be moved inside to unload.

Select **Light (yellow)** for light volume.  'Light' status indicates that the package car has a small amount of volume that is able to be consolidated into another car.

Select **'Empty' (green)** to indicate that the package car is empty and contains no volume that needs to be unloaded.

## Volume Filters

At the bottom of the screen there are 5 filters that display the total number of Unchecked, Heavy, Light, Empty, and All cars.
Clicking on one of these buttons will display all the cars of that volume type.
