## Description

An application that provides UPS management teams a real-time solution to track and update the status of UPS Package cars, designed to be used by multiple members of management simultaneously.

## Installation

Visit the Metro App site. Open your browser menu and click 'Install Metro App.' Open the application from your desktop or mobile phone.

## Usage

The app displays all the package cars in your operation.  To update the status of a package car first locate the number of the package car you want to update either by scrolling to it or 
search by number.

### Search

The search feature displays all package cars that contain the number searched for.  Then select the option that reflects the status of the package car.

### Select Status

Select 'Heavy' (red) for heavy volume.  Selecting 'Heavy' indicates that the package car needs to be moved inside to unload.  Select Light (yellow) for light volume.  'Light' status indicates that the package car has a small amount of volume that is able to be consolidated into another car.  Select 'Empty' to indicate that the package car is empty and contains no volume that needs to be unloaded.  

### Volume Filters


Please note that Metro App will automatically update itself to display the most current package car data.  This includes the package car status updates made by other members of management.
